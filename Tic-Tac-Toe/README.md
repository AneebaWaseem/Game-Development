## Features

- The game ends when a player wins or when all cells are filled, resulting in a draw.

## How to Play

1. **Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):**

    ```bash
    gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe
    ```

2. **Run the executable:**

    ```bash
    ./tic_tac_toe
    ```

3. **Players take turns to input their moves. Enter the row and column separated by a space.**

4. **The game continues until a player wins or it's a draw.**

5. **Enjoy the classic Tic-Tac-Toe!**
